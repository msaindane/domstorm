#### TODOs:

* We need a sub-domain or few to test cross-sub domain stuff.
* Unfortunately, some APIs like XHR, doesn't throw DOM Exceptions and we need to check the request headers from a server to carry out a certain test.
* How are we going to compare the results with the specs?
* 

###### Modules
* XHR Request Headers
* Security sensitive stuffs overriding.
* What cannot be overridden?
* CORS policies.
* Erland Oftedal's CSP check.
